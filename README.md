online platform for live-coded music performances

- online communities
- event-based
- 

### Problems with live-coding

- Organisation efforts require loads of volunteering work
- steep technical curve for participation
- technical setup causes failures
- errors during streaming sessions due to lack of multitasking skills
- hard to organize projects, files, versions, sets, songs, etc.
- quick musical ideas may take long time to code
  - most musicians will not really dive into better coding practices
    - refactoring requires communication and abstract thought
      - if we create a new thing, nobody will find it
        - user-based contributions will probably not be well documented
- brilliantt code based knowledge gets lost in streams of time unnoticed
- copying is hard
- no easy way to publish live-coding based music "works"


### Solution

- Organize sessions, events with multiple streamed line-ups
- Live coding music platform
- Ability to view, listen, copy, fork other people's code
- Add ideas to library
- Share ideas, snippets, code
- Ability to store songs, acts, custom file structures, etc.
- Get a Shareable link to live stream current performance
- Live stream view vs. audience view
- Ability to contribute functions, algorithms, snippets
- Publish your works, live performances
- Create tutorials for your musical ideas
