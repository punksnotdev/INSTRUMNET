### Problems with live-coding

- Organisation efforts require loads of volunteering work
- steep technical curve for participation
- technical setup causes failures
- errors during streaming sessions due to lack of multitasking skills
- hard to organize projects, files, versions, sets, songs, etc.
- quick musical ideas may take long time to code
